# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

* `jj [op] undo` and `jj op restore` used to take the operation to undo or
  restore to as an argument to `-o/--operation`. It is now a positional
  argument instead (i.e. `jj undo -o abc123` is now written `jj undo abc123`).

* An alias that is not configured as a string list (e.g. `my-status = "status"`
  instead of `my-status = ["status"]`) is now an error instead of a warning.

* (#250) `jj log` now defaults to showing only commits that are not on any
  remote branches (plus their closest commit on the remote branch for context).
  Use `jj log -r 'all()'` for the old behavior. Read more about revsets
  [here](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj/blob/main/docs/revsets.md).

* `jj new` now always checks out the new commit (used to be only if the parent
  was `@`).

### New features

* `jj rebase` now accepts a `--branch/-b <revision>` argument, which can be used
  instead of `-r` or `-s` to specify which commits to rebase. It will rebase the
  whole branch, relative to the destination. The default mode has changed from
  `-r @` to `-b @`.

* The new `jj print` command prints the contents of a file in a revision.

* (#243) The new `jj git remotes list` command lists the configured remotes and
  their URLs.

* `jj move` and `jj squash` now lets you limit the set of changes to move by
  specifying paths on the command line (in addition to the `--interactive`
  mode). For example, use `jj move --to @-- foo` to move the changes to file
  (or directory) `foo` in the working copy to the grandparent commit.

* `jj split` now lets you specify on the CLI which paths to include in the first
  commit. The interactive diff-editing is not started when you do that.

* Sparse checkouts are now supported. In fact, all working copies are now
  "sparse", only to different degrees. Use the `jj sparse` command to manage
  the paths included in the sparse checkout.

* Configuration is now also read from `~/.jjconfig.toml`.

* The `$JJ_CONFIG` environment variable can now point to a directory. If it
  does, all files in the directory will be read, in alphabetical order.

* The `$VISUAL` environment is now respected and overrides `$EDITOR`. The new
  `ui.editor` config has higher priority than both of them. There is also a new
  `$JJ_EDITOR` environment variable, which has even higher priority than the
  config.

* You can now use `-` and `+` in revset symbols. You used to have to quote
  branch names like `my-feature` in nested quotes (outer layer for your shell)
  like `jj co '"my-feature"'`. The quoting is no longer needed.

* The new revset function `connected(x)` is the same as `x:x`.

* The new revset function `roots(x)` finds commits in the set that are not
  descendants of other commits in the set.

* ssh-agent is now detected even if `$SSH_AGENT_PID` is not set (as long as
  `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is set). This should help at least macOS users where
  ssh-agent is launched by default and only `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is set.

* When importing from a git, any commits that are no longer referenced on the
  git side will now be abandoned on the jj side as well. That means that
  `jj git fetch` will now abandon unreferenced commits and rebase any local
  changes you had on top.

* `jj git push` gained a `--change <revision>` argument. When that's used, it
  will create a branch named after the revision's change ID, so you don't have
  to create a branch yourself. By default, the branch name will start with
  `push-`, but this can be overridden by the `push.branch-prefix` config
  setting.

* Diff editor command arguments can now be specified by config file.
  Example:

      [merge-tools.kdiff3]
      program = "kdiff3"
      edit-args = ["--merge", "--cs", "CreateBakFiles=0"]

* `jj branch` can accept any number of branches to update, rather than just one.

* Aliases can now call other aliases.

* `jj log` now accepts a `--reversed` option, which will show older commits
  first.

### Fixed bugs

* When rebasing a conflict where one side modified a file and the other side
  deleted it, we no longer automatically resolve it in favor of the modified
  content (this was a regression from commit c0ae4b16e8c4).

* Errors are now printed to stderr (they used to be printed to stdout).

* Updating the working copy to a commit where a file's executable bit changed
  but the contents was the same used to lead to a crash. That has now been
  fixed.

* If one side of a merge modified a directory and the other side deleted it, it
  used to be considered a conflict. The same was true if both sides added a
  directory with different files in. They are now merged as if the missing
  directory had been empty.

* When using `jj move` to move part of a commit into an ancestor, any branches
  pointing to the source commit used to be left on a hidden intermediate commit.
  They are now correctly updated.

* `jj untrack` now requires at least one path (allowing no arguments was a UX
  bug).

* `jj rebase` now requires at least one destination (allowing no arguments was a
  UX bug).

* `jj restore --to <rev>` now restores from the working copy (it used to restore
  from the working copy's parent).

* You now get a proper error message instead of a crash when `$EDITOR` doesn't
  exist or exits with an error.

* Global arguments, such as `--at-op=<operation>`, can now be passed before
  an alias.

* Fixed relative path to the current directory in output to be `.` instead of
  empty string.

* When adding a new workspace, the parent of the current workspace's current
  checkout will be checked out. That was always the intent, but the root commit
  was accidentally checked out instead.

* When checking out a commit, the previous commit is no longer abandoned if it
  has a non-empty description.

* When using `jj move/squash/unsquash` results in the source commit becoming
  empty, it is no longer abandoned if it is checked out (in any workspace).

## [0.4.0] - 2022-04-02

### Breaking changes

* Dropped support for config in `~/.jjconfig`. Your configuration is now read
  from `<config dir>/jj/config.toml`, where `<config dir>` is
  `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}` or `~/.config/` on Linux,
  `~/Library/Application Support/` on macOS, and `~\AppData\Roaming\` on
  Windows.

### New features

* You can now set an environment variable called `$JJ_CONFIG` to a path to a
  config file. That will then be read instead of your regular config file. This
  is mostly intended for testing and scripts.

* The [standard `$NO_COLOR` environment variable](https://no-color.org/) is now
  respected.

* `jj new` now lets you specify a description with `--message/-m`.

* When you check out a commit, the old commit no longer automatically gets
  abandoned if it's empty and has descendants, it only gets abandoned if it's
  empty and does not have descendants.

* (#111) When undoing an earlier operation, any new commits on top of commits
  from the undone operation will be rebased away. For example, let's say you
  rebase commit A so it becomes a new commit A', and then you create commit B
  on top of A'. If you now undo the rebase operation, commit B will be rebased
  to be on top of A instead. The same logic is used if the repo was modified
  by concurrent operations (so if one operation added B on top of A, and one
  operation rebased A as A', then B would be automatically rebased on top of
  A'). See #111 for more examples.

* `jj log` now accepts `-p`/`--patch` option.

### Fixed bugs

* Fixed crash on `jj init --git-repo=.` (it almost always crashed).

* When sharing the working copy with a Git repo, the automatic importing and
  exporting (sometimes?) didn't happen on Windows.
