# This file contains the config settings available to jj/Jujutsu.
# It is also a valid TOML file and thus can be used as a template.
# The config setting are located at ~/.jjconfig.toml so either copy
# this file to that location or create a new file.

# See the TOML site (https://toml.io/en/) for more on syntax,
# but one thing to remember is that anything under a heading can be dotted
# e.g. user.name = "YOUR NAME"
# is equivalent to
# [user]
#   name = "YOUR NAME"

# That's a good place to start with actual settings:

[user]
  name = "YOUR NAME" # Don't forget to change name and email to your own!
  email = "YOUR_EMAIL@example.com"

[ui]
# This setting overrides the NO_COLOR environment variable (if set)
#   color = false # Turn off colours.

# The default editor is set here via ui.editor,
# though there are several places to set it. The priority is as follows:
# JJ_EDITOR env var > ui.editor > VISUAL env var > EDITOR env var
# Pico is the default editor in the absence of any other setting.

#   editor = pico
#   editor = nano
#   editor = vim
#   editor = nvim
#   editor = emacs

# For GUI editors you possibly need to use a `-w` or `--wait`
#   editor = code -w       # VS Code
#   editor = bbedit -w     # BBEdit
#   editor = subl -n -w    # Sublime Text
#   editor = mate -w       # TextMate
#   editor = "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin # Notepad++
#   editor = idea --temp-project --wait

# Diffing

# The default diff tool is meld (needs to be installed)
# but this can be changed, e.g.
#   diff-editor = "vimdiff"

# Merge tool

# Merge tool options are loaded via [merge-tools.<name>]
# e.g. to use kdiff3
# [merge-tools.kdiff3]
#   program = "kdiff3"
#   edit-args = ["--merge", "--cs", "CreateBakFiles=0"]
