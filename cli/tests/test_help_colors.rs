              Don't snapshot the working copy, and don't update it
              
              By default, Jujutsu snapshots the working copy at the beginning of every command. The
              working copy is also updated at the end of the command, if the command modified the
              working-copy commit (`@`). If you want to avoid snapshotting the working copy and instead
              see a possibly stale working-copy commit, you can use `--ignore-working-copy`. This may be
              useful e.g. in a command prompt, especially if you have another process that commits the
              working copy.
              
              Loading the repository at a specific operation with `--at-operation` implies
              `--ignore-working-copy`.

          [1m[32m--ignore-immutable[0m
              Allow rewriting immutable commits
              
              By default, Jujutsu prevents rewriting commits in the configured set of immutable commits.
              This option disables that check and lets you rewrite any commit but the root commit.
              
              This option only affects the check. It does not affect the `immutable_heads()` revset or
              the `immutable` template keyword.

          [1m[32m--at-operation[0m[32m [0m[32m<AT_OPERATION>[0m
              Operation to load the repo at
              
              Operation to load the repo at. By default, Jujutsu loads the repo at the most recent
              operation, or at the merge of the divergent operations if any.
              
              You can use `--at-op=<operation ID>` to see what the repo looked like at an earlier
              operation. For example `jj --at-op=<operation ID> st` will show you what `jj st` would
              have shown you when the given operation had just finished. `--at-op=@` is pretty much the
              same as the default except that divergent operations will never be merged.
              
              Use `jj op log` to find the operation ID you want. Any unambiguous prefix of the operation
              ID is enough.
              
              When loading the repo at an earlier operation, the working copy will be ignored, as if
              `--ignore-working-copy` had been specified.
              
              It is possible to run mutating commands when loading the repo at an earlier operation.
              Doing that is equivalent to having run concurrent commands starting at the earlier
              operation. There's rarely a reason to do that, but it is possible.
