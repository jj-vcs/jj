    // Growing the "undo-stack" works as follows. See also the
    // [redo-stack](./redo.rs), which works in a similar way.
    //
    // - If the operation to undo is a regular one (not an undo-operation), simply
    //   undo it (== restore its parent).
    // - If the operation to undo is an undo-operation itself, undo that operation
    //   to which the previous undo-operation restored the repo.
    // - If the operation to restore to is an undo-operation, restore directly to
    //   the original operation. This avoids creating a linked list of
    //   undo-operations, which subsequently may have to be walked with an
    //   inefficient loop.
    //
    // This described behavior leads to "jumping over" old undo-stacks if the
    // current one grows into it. Consider this op-log example:
    //
    // * G "undo: restore A" -------+
    // |                            |
    // * F "undo: restore B" -----+ |
    // |                          | |
    // * E                        | |
    // |                          | |
    // * D "undo: restore B" -+   | |
    // |                      |   | |
    // * C                    |   | |
    // |                      |   | |
    // * B   <----------------+ <-+ |
    // |                            |
    // * A   <----------------------+
    //
    // It was produced by the following sequence of events:
    // - do normal operations A, B and C
    // - undo C, restoring to B
    // - do normal operation E
    // - undo E, restoring to B again (NOT to D)
    // - undo F, restoring to A
    //
    // Notice that running `undo` after having undone E leads to A being
    // restored (as opposed to C). The undo-stack spanning from F to B was
    // "jumped over".
