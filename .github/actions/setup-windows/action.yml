  steps:
    # The GitHub Actions hosted Windows runners have a slow persistent
    # `C:` drive and a temporary `D:` drive with better throughput. The
    # repository checkout is placed on `D:` by default, but the user
    # profile is on `C:`, slowing down access to temporary directories
    # and the Rust toolchain we install. Since our build environment is
    # ephemeral anyway, we can save a couple minutes of CI time by
    # placing everything on `D:`.
    #
    # Some projects have reported even bigger wins by mounting a VHDX
    # virtual drive with a ReFS file system on it, with or without the
    # native Dev Drive feature available in Windows 2025, but it seems
    # to make things slightly slower for us overall compared to `D:`.
    # Further investigation and experimentation would be welcome!

        # Set up D: drive

        # Short file names are disabled by default on the `D:` drive,
        # which breaks some of our tests. Enable them.
        #
        # This has a slight performance penalty, and wonâ€™t be possible
        # if we switch to ReFS/Dev Drives. The alternatives are to
        # reduce CI coverage for the security mitigation the tests are
        # checking, or arrange for those tests to take a separate path
        # to a drive that supports short file names to use instead of
        # the primary temporary directory.
