comment "We are in the octocat/Hello-World repo.
The \"operation log\" shows the operations
so far:"
run_command "jj op log"

comment "We are going to make some changes to show
how the operation log works. Let's add a file, set
a description, and rebase onto the \"test\" branch:"
run_command "echo stuff > new-file"
run_command "jj describe -m stuff"
run_command "jj rebase -d test"

comment "We are now going to make another change off of
master:"
run_command "jj co master"
run_command "jj describe -m \"other stuff\""

comment "The repo now looks like this:"
run_command "jj log"
comment "The most recent portion of the operation log
is:"
run_command "jj op log --color=always | head"

comment "Let's undo that rebase operation:"
rebase_op=$(jj --color=never op log | grep '^â—‰  ' | sed '2q;d' | cut -b4-15)
run_command "jj undo $rebase_op"

comment "Note that only the rebase was undone, and the
subsequent \"other stuff\" change was not undone:"
run_command "jj log"

comment "We can also see what the repo looked like
after the rebase operation:"
run_command "jj --at-op $rebase_op log"

comment "Let's say we instead want to go back to the
state of the repo right after the rebase:"
run_command "jj op restore $rebase_op"

# TODO: Explain and demo that undo and restore are also recorded? Remove demo
# of --at-op?
comment "We're now back to before the \"other stuff\"
change existed:"
